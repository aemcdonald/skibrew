## About The Project
SkiBrew is an application that allows users to view local breweries near major Colorado ski areas and keep track of their favorite breweries for future vacations. This was a final solo project assigned during the third module of the Front-End Program at the Turing School of Software and Design. The learning goals of this project included demonstrating fundamental concepts of React including architecting a React application from scratch, implementing class and functional components and utilizing React Router for path transitions and displays. Robust unit and integration testing was also implemented for each component utilizing the Jest testing suite.
